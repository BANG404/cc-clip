// Package tunnelmgr implements the managed persistent tunnel core from
// issue #108 Phase 1A: a minimal state store, a managed non-interactive SSH
// backend, and a single-tunnel supervisor that can be driven manually.
//
// Phase 1A scope only: no LaunchAgent, no enable/disable commands, no SSH
// config migration, no rollback. The supervisor runs only when explicitly
// started (foreground `cc-clip tunnel run <host>` or a test harness); the
// legacy interactive `RemoteForward` workflow is untouched and remains the
// default behavior of every existing command.
//
// Health semantics are built on the v0.9.2 probe primitives in
// internal/tunnel (ProbeHealth, RemoteHealthProbeCommand,
// ClassifyRemoteProbeOutput). Nothing in this package reimplements them, and
// everything except a proven-healthy state fails closed: a supervisor state
// is healthy only when the local daemon, managed ssh child, public remote
// probe, and authenticated expected-instance probe all pass.

// State is the supervisor's aggregate lifecycle state, persisted in the
// tunnel state file. It deliberately collapses both health dimensions
// (ssh child process, remote probe outcome) into one exhaustive enum so that
// anything the supervisor cannot prove falls into its own non-healthy state
// instead of being folded into a boolean.
